When I was first asked to program an alien shooting game in bootcamp, my mind couldn't seem to advance beyond the shooting, the players, and the how to successfully track the ever-changing score. And, yes, I've played video games. Back in the 90's I used to watch my cousins play Nintendo for hours, hoping they'd pass me the zapper so I could shoot some ducks too, or at least leave the room for an extended period of time so I could take matters into my own hands. Later it was Lara Croft, only this time I was in the 5th grade and cousinless and the hope now was that my parents would finally buy me the full version since I was so over beating the demo. After I was married, the hours spent watching my husband prestige in Call of Duty until I literally couldn't watch anymore from all the FPS motion was where my shooting game experiences paused. So, I know a tad about games that require firing weapons. Hmmmph. And you'd think after all that I should've known how to program an simple alien shooting game. Well, so much for thinking. 

## Essential (or core) Game Loops

I've learned a thing or two since that day in bootcamp, and I've come to realize that every game has a process that, at its core, repeats again and again. This is the essential game loop, and it's a huge reason why I didn't understand hwo to get beyond the shooting, the players, and the ever-changing score way back when. 

When thinking about the essential game loop in Hangman, I'd agree it's this: 

1. Take the players guess
2. Check that the player's guess is a valid letter against the word you've chosen
3. Keep track of the letters the player has guessed, whether correct or wrong
4. Show the player their progress

Repeat
