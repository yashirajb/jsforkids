Game structure

Choose a random word---happens once (no loop)
Take the player's guess--happens multiple times (loop)
Quit the game if the player wants to ---happens multiple times (loop)
Check that the player's guess is a valid letter--happens multiple times (loop)
Keep track of letters the player has guessed---happens multiple times(loop)
Show the player their progress---happens multiple times (loop)
Finish when the player has guessed the word---happens once (no loop)



Choose a random word 
Random word chosen
While the word has not been guessed {
    Show the player their current progress
    Get a guess from the player

    If the player wants to quit the game {
        Quit the game
    } Else If the guess is not a single letter {
        Tell the player to choose a single letter
    } Else {
        If the guess is in the word {
            Update the player's progress with the guess
        }
    }
}

Congratulate the player on guessing the word 


How do we track the state of the word?

We can keep track of the players progress by keeping a collection of 
blank spcase and filling them in as the player guesses the correct letters. We can do this
by using an array of blanks for each letter in the word. This will be the answer array and it will 
be filled with the player's correct guesses as they are made. 
Each blank will be the string "_". 

I'll also use a variable to keep track of the number of letters that remain to be guessed. 
For every correctly guessed variable, the variable will decrease by 1. Once the variable hits zero, the player will have won.
